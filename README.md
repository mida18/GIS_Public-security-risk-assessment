# GIS_Public-security-risk-assessment

## Task description
> Taking the Daan District of Taipei City as an example, we tried to use the points, attributes, and layer data obtained from publicly available government data to create a "crime hot spot analysis" with different GIS analysis modules. With the purpose of "strengthening crime prevention for high-risk groups in society", we have customized the risk level calculation and hope that the final visual presentation can provide relevant police units as a reference when formulating crime prevention strategies.
